 We have identified that we need images to be placed in the github repository so that we can build this correctly.  There are two separate sections of the index page, and we have identified the names of each image.   
 
##Top Index Page
There are 2 images missing here.

* Upper Right - http://localhost:8080/img/proskriptive-image.jpg
